# Project-----Mask-Detection-and-Face-Recognition

The project is based on Deep Learning, which is a sub field of machine learning, 
concerned with algorithms inspired by the structure and function of the brain called 
artificial neural networks. In the project, TensorFlow is used, which is an open-source 
software library created by Google for machine learning applications. It is used for 
detecting, identifying and tracking objects through the camera in real time. The project 
uses MobileNetV2 network which is trained on ImageNet dataset to train the model to 
detect face masks in real time. It detects the face mask, recognizes faces without mask 
and creates an excel sheet with the names of recognized faces. The main purpose of this 
project is to create excel sheets with the name of students without masks in college.

KEY WORDS : Deep Learning, Image Processing, Tensorflow, Keras
